Here are some simple rules and features to be officially added:
- No spaces, numbers, apostrophes, or other special characters, only letters can be entered.
- Like Wordle, you have only 6 attempts to guess.
  - Each time you take a guess, one of the monster's stats is revealed to help you guess the creature.
  - All of the stats will be revealed at the end of the game.
- Unlike Wordle, there not every answer will be the same length. (As of right now, the longest word is 22 letters)
- You can use the keyboard on screen or your actual keyboard to enter your guess.
- If you aren't sure which monsters exist, you can check the list of monsters underneath the stats.
